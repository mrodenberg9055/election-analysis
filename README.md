# election-analysis
## Analysis Overview
- For this analysis we were tasked with helping with an election audit to determine the winner of a local election.  Originally we were asked to help figure out who the winner was by programatically tallying votes from the election.  Later we were asked to determine which counties had the highest voter turnout and the total votes for that county.  

## Audit Results
- After conducting our analysis we can see that 369,711 people turned out for the election from 3 different counties. 

- Votes by County
- Most votes by county
- Votes by Candiddate
- Who won, total votes, percent of total votes

## Summary
- After our analysis we can see that Denver County had a significatly higher turnout than other counties and that Diana DeGette won the election with over 73% of the votes.  Seth and Tom should be able to reuse the program for other elections assuming that the file structure does not change or that they don't need any additional functionality added to the results.
