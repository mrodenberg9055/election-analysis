## Analysis Overview
- For this analysis we were tasked with helping with an election audit to determine the winner of a local election.  Originally we were asked to help figure out who the winner was by programatically tallying votes from the election.  Later we were asked to determine which counties had the highest voter turnout and the total votes for that county.  

## Audit Results
- After conducting our analysis we can see that 369,711 people turned out for the election from 3 different counties.

- Of the 3 counties where votes were counted, Denver county had by far the largest turnout with over 80 percent of the total votes coming from Denver county.  The next highest total was just over 10% of the total votes coming from Jefferson county.

Charles Casper Stockham received 23% of the votes or just over 85k total votes for a second place fininsh.  But those totals were no where near the amount of votes Diana DeGette received, totaling over 272k votes or just over 73% of total votes. Making her the winner of the election.

## Summary
- After our analysis we can see that Denver County had a significatly higher turnout than other counties and that Diana DeGette won the election with over 73% of the votes.  Seth and Tom should be able to reuse the program for other elections assuming that the file structure does not change or that they don't need any additional functionality added to the results.
